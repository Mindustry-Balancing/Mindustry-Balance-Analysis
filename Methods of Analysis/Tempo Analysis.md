# Tempo Analysis




---

Draft, btw need to update links to this thing (none are connected yet)

Why Tempo is so important, to be given into its own section, is that it analysis when and where each piece of content appears.

Sure, maybe surge cyclone is the best performer, but when taking into account with cost and build order considerations, trying to deploy something like it for T2 is inherently wasteful and unrealistic.

No matter how strong the performance of a unit, its position on when and how much it costs determines its usability.

(Terminology)

Build Order
- The term from the PvP community, this is the order on which buildings or factories are placed at a specific order.
- The "best" build order has the best Tempo.

Tempo
- The speed and effeciency of an action.

The fundamental thought at play (and why I used this term from chess/turn based games, which is just a turn)

Is that the faster you can get the winning position (enough units to win the game), the more likely you would win.

afterall, it is more better to go cheap so you have more resources to develop

maybe going early agression would go great if you can win asap

and while an attack may be costly, the time needed to rebuild for the opponent might be more "expensive" than your attack, thus overall, the attacker gains tempo and can finish the job with the leading advanatge.


(Example, its better to invest on more silicon so that the strategy if reaching Surge is faster).

... (future section, Modes of Aggression)

The Level of Aggression (or aggresion for short) is typically measured by the Unit Cost : Defense Cost Ratio.
- This specific ratio can be said as the number of choke points needed to break even.

The more it approaches 1 : 1, the more aggressive plays can be made as it becomes more difficult for the defending player to win in such trades.

Cost here can be a cumulative cost, with the Upfront Cost (deteriorates over time for units), the Production / Running Costs, and any external forms like APM.

There are multiple areas where aggression can occur.
- Front Wall Defense (Preplaced)
    - Turrets are concentrated and preplaced at chokepoints (regions that require turret coverage).

- Internal Defense (Preplaced)
    - Turrets are placed internally within schematics or factory formations.

- Reactive Defense
    - Turrets are placed actively in response to a breaching army.
